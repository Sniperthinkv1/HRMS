# üîß Mixed Content Error - Fixed!

## Problem
The frontend on Vercel (HTTPS) was trying to make HTTP requests, causing a "Mixed Content" error:
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://hrms-frontend-phi.vercel.app/login' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://hrms-frontend-phi.vercel.app/api/public/login/'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

## Root Cause
The API configuration was falling back to using the frontend domain instead of the backend domain, 
and was constructing HTTP URLs instead of HTTPS.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `src/config/apiConfig.ts`
- ‚úÖ Added environment variable support (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`)
- ‚úÖ Improved hostname detection for Vercel
- ‚úÖ Added console logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Ensured HTTPS is used for all production requests

### 2. Updated `src/vite-env.d.ts`
- ‚úÖ Added TypeScript definitions for Vite environment variables

### 3. Environment Variables (`.env`)
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://hrms-production-ed39.up.railway.app
VITE_APP_ENV=production
```

## How It Works Now

### Priority Order:
1. **Environment Variable** (highest priority)
   - If `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set ‚Üí Use it
   
2. **Hostname Detection**
   - `hrms-frontend-phi.vercel.app` ‚Üí `https://hrms-production-ed39.up.railway.app`
   - `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` ‚Üí `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
   - `15.207.246.171` ‚Üí `http://15.207.246.171`
   
3. **Fallback**
   - Match protocol of current page (HTTPS ‚Üí HTTPS, HTTP ‚Üí HTTP)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Vercel Configuration

You MUST set these environment variables in Vercel:

### Go to: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

Add these variables:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://hrms-production-ed39.up.railway.app
VITE_APP_ENV = production
```

**Then redeploy your Vercel app!**

## Testing

After redeploying, open the browser console and look for these logs:
```
[API Config] Using environment variable: https://hrms-production-ed39.up.railway.app
```
or
```
[API Config] Vercel detected, using Railway backend
```

All API calls should now go to:
```
https://hrms-production-ed39.up.railway.app/api/...
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Frontend redeployed on Vercel
- [ ] Browser console shows correct API base URL
- [ ] Login page loads without Mixed Content errors
- [ ] API requests use HTTPS (check Network tab)
- [ ] Login works successfully
